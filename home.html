    Christian von Koenigsegg got the idea to build his own car after watching the Norwegian
    stop-motion animated movie The Pinchcliffe Grand Prix in his youth. At 22 years old,
    Koenigsegg gathered SKr 60,000,000 from investors and founded Koenigsegg Automotive in
    1994.

    Initially, Koenigsegg Automotive was based in Olofström. In the early 2000s, the company
    moved to Ängelholm. On 22 February 2003, one of the production facilities caught
    fire and was badly damaged. Koenigsegg then acquired an abandoned air field to use
    as his new factory building and in late 2003, one of the two large fighter-jet hangars
    and an office building were converted into a car factory. Since then, the company is
    located near the still-active Ängelholm airport. Koenigsegg controls and uses the
    former military runway for shakedown runs of production cars and high-speed testing.
